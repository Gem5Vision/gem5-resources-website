When a disk image is created, it captures all of the data on the original device, including the operating system and any installed software.\n\nIn computer architecture simulation, disk images of operating systems are often used to create virtual environments for testing and development. By simulating the behavior of a real-world operating system, researchers can evaluate system performance, explore potential improvements, and test different configurations and scenarios."}}]);
