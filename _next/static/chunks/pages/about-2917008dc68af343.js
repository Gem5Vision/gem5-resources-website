Users may simulate a wide variety of hardware, with an equally wide variety of workloads.\nHowever, requiring users to find and configure workloads for gem5 (their own disk images, their own OS boots, their own tests, etc.) is a significant investment, and a hurdle to many.\n\nThe purpose of gem5 resources is therefore *to provide a stable set of commonly used resources, with proven and documented compatibility with gem5*.\nIn addition to this, gem5 resources also puts emphasis on *reproducibility of experiments* by providing citable, stable resources, tied to a particular release of gem5.\n\n## Using gem5 resources\n\nIf you find one of the gem5-resources useful be sure to cite both the resources (see the README) and the [gem5art and gem5-resources paper](https://arch.cs.ucdavis.edu/assets/papers/ispass21-gem5art.pdf).\n\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{bruce2021gem5art,\n  title={Enabling Reproducible and Agile Full-System Simulation},\n  author={Bruce, Bobby R. and Akram, Ayaz and Nguyen, Hoa and Roarty, Kyle and Samani, Mahyar and Fariborz, Marjan and Trivikram, Reddy and Sinclair, Matthew D. and Lowe-Power, Jason},\n  booktitle={In Proceedings of the 2021 IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software (ISPASS \'21)},\n  year={2021},\n  organization={IEEE}\n}\n\n```\n\n## UNDER CONSTRUCTION\n\nThis website is currently under construction.\nYou can see the following links for the current information on gem5-resources.\nMore information will be here soon!\n\n* [Documentation on gem5-resources](http://www.gem5.org/documentation/general_docs/gem5_resources/)\n* [Source for gem5-resources](https://gem5.googlesource.com/public/gem5-resources/+/refs/heads/stable/)\n* [README for gem5-resources](https://gem5.googlesource.com/public/gem5-resources/+/refs/heads/stable/README.md)\n* [The gem5art and gem5-resources paper](https://arch.cs.ucdavis.edu/assets/papers/ispass21-gem5art.pdf)\n'})})}}},function(e){e.O(0,[475,774,888,179],function(){return e(e.s=1233)}),_N_E=e.O()}]);
