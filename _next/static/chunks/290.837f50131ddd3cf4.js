Benchmarks are often run as part of a benchmark suite, which consists of multiple tests designed to measure different aspects of system performance, such as CPU, memory, or disk performance.\n\nBenchmark suites are commonly used in computer architecture simulation to evaluate the performance of a simulated system. They provide a standardized set of tests that can be used to measure and compare the performance of different simulated systems, allowing researchers to evaluate the impact of changes to the system design or architecture."}}]);
